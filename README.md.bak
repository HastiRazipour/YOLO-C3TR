# My Project

This project uses a custom-trained neural network to classify medical images.

## 📁 Structure
- `src/` contains training and evaluation code
- `model/` has the stracture model (.ymal file)
- `results/` includes evaluation results and plots

## 🧠 Model
The model is a yolo with C3TR trained on my dataset for joubar road damage detection.

## 🔧 Requirements
