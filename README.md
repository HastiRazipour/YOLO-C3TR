# YOLO+Transformer

This project combines the power of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for fast object detection with the C3TR (Context-aware Cross-scale Transformer for Object Tracking) architecture to enhance accuracy and context understanding on a custom dataset.

## colab code for train

## üìÅ Structure
- `src/` contains training and evaluation code
- `model/` has the stracture model (.ymal file)
- `results/` includes evaluation results and plots

## üß† Model
The model is a yolo with C3TR trained on my dataset for joubar road damage detection.
